            <h1>Skill</h1>
              <p>A skill is the learned ability to perform an action with determined results with good execution often within a given 
                amount of time, energy, or both. Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills. For example,
                in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, 
                whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job. Skill usually 
                requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.
                <br>
                A skill may be called an art when it represents a body of knowledge or branch of learning, as in the art of medicine or the art of war.
                Although the arts are also skills, there are many skills that form an art but have no connection to the fine arts. A practice is when the 
                learned skill is put into practice. An art or skill may be the basis for a profession, trade, or craft.
                <br>
                People need a broad range of skills to contribute to the modern economy. A joint ASTD and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, 
                the workplace is changing, and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it. Three broad categories of skills are 
                suggested and these are technical, human, and conceptual. The first two can be substituted with hard and soft skills, respectively
